# SpaceX - Launches

SpaceX - Launches is an application that relies on the unofficial [SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) to show SpaceX launches information.
<br />

The web application has four core functionalities:
- Fetch and display the next launch from the API and show it in a card;
- Fetch and display the previous launch from the API and show it in a card;
- Fetch and display the incoming launches from the API and show them on a list with infinite scroller;
- Fetch and display the past launches from the API and show them on a list with infinite scroller;

The API has 5 endpoints:
- /spacex-api/launches/latest : Returns the latest launch
- /spacex-api/launches/next : Returns the next launch
- /spacex-api/launches/upcoming : Return the upcoming launches
- /spacex-api/launches/past : Return the past launches
- /spacex-api/launches/next_and_latest : Returns the next and the latest launches

You can check the working version [here](https://spacexlaunches.paulotarso.dev).
